UDP Socket based Chat Client in C#

I wrote this project to practice UDP networking, my goal is to better understand how to handle networking traffic. 
Additional goals are to make a predictable and to some degree reliable networking solution using UDP bulding out an acknowledgement system by myself. 
Eventually compare it to a similar application that utilize TCP sockets and compare the reliability, performance and overhead.

TODO: 
- [ ] Retry connecting a couple of times
- [ ] Break down code into smaller methods
- [ ] Make it possible to choose ip and port of the server to connect to through the terminal/console
- [ ] Send ack to server when message is received
